# Email_spam_Detection

TITLE OF THE PROJECT â€“ The title of the project is Email Spam Detection based on Machine Learning. In this project we compare the best ML model by using several algorithms.



Workflow of the project- 

1.Data Exploration
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.Data Pre-processing
4.Data Manipulation
5.Feature Selection/Extraction
6.Predictive Modelling
7.Project Outcomes & Conclusion

Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:
1.The Dataset was quiet small totalling around 4600 samples & after preprocessing 14.6% of the datasamples were dropped.
2.The samples were slightly imbalanced after processing, hence SMOTE Technique was applied on the data to balance the classes, adding 16.7% more samples to the dataset.
3.Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the relationship between the feature-set.
4.Feature Selection/Eliminination was carried out and appropriate features were shortlisted.
5.Testing multiple algorithms with fine-tuning hyperparamters gave us some understanding on the model performance for various algorithms on this specific dataset.
6.The Random Forest Classifier & XG-Boost performed exceptionally well on the current dataset, considering Precision Score as the key-metric.
7.Yet it wise to also consider simpler model like Logistic Regression as it is more generalisable & is computationally less expensive, but comes at the cost of slight misclassifications.
